## 🔍 Why This Exists

As a developer, I analyzed several online password generators and noticed the following disturbing patterns:

- ❗ Network requests to external servers during or after password generation
- ❗ Hidden API calls or analytics scripts
- ❗ Possibility of password values being logged without user consent

These are **critical security and privacy risks**. Your passwords must remain confidential — always.

### ✅ My Promise

This password generator is:

- **Fully static**: Runs only in your browser
- **Open & Transparent**: You can inspect the source code
- **Secure by Design**: Generates passwords locally using JavaScript
- **No Dependencies**: No calls to external APIs, no trackers, no 3rd-party analytics

**You can open DevTools → Network tab → Generate a password → See that no requests are made.**
